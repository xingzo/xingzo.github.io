- consider adding a `.gitignore` to your root director and adding `.DS_Store` to line 1 to ignore `.DS_Store` files from your github add list.

- Amazing html semantic setup!  I could see your site from reading it!

- Remove any unused or commented-out code from your production codebase

- Add a `document.ready(function(){})` wrapper around your js file to ensure it runs after your html is loaded. This would allow you to link your file above the html which is considered more ideal (yours is still acceptable, but not so much in SF)

- Awesome extraction of larger functions from your callbacks.  This shows a mature understanding of convention and elegant code.  

- Masonry! Sweeeeeeeet!

- It's clear you have a fine understanding of CSS selectors and nested queries.  Great work!

- The iphone response is awesome, but the images are blank :(
